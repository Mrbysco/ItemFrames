# Item Frames #

## About ##
This mod adds Item Frames to the game. They can be placed on walls and allow items to be inserted or removed by interacting with the frame while holding an item or with an empty hand.

They can be crafted in the Furniture Bench using 2 Tree Trunk + 1 Tree Sap. (The Bamboo variant requires Bamboo Trunk and the Light Temple version requires Marble)
